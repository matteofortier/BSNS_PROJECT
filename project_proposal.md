**Problem: **The Epic Games store (a PC video game distribution platform) has siginificantly less active monthly users compared to the Steam store (a competitor). These platforms may have deals to be the exclusive distributor/seller of certain games. Epic Games wants to know which games they should prioritise having (exclusive) rights to, in order to grow their platform. This includes existing games, or upcoming games yet to be released on any platform.

**Impact Hypothesis:** By understanding what games are successful (average play time, current active players) in the steam store, Epic Games can more intentionally target specific games, or categories of games, to be distributed on their platform. 

**Desired Business Impact:** More games that are succesful (average play time, current active players) are distributed by Epic Games, leading to a growth in the platform.

**Data Description:**

The following dataset will be used:

The "Steam Store Games" dataset includes 27000 rows of games sold on the Steam store. Each game has 17 collumns of attributes associated with that game including, average play time, ratings, developers, publishers, categories and genres.
